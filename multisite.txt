 The Reseller (Vendor) and end user concept termed as Multi-vendor or either Marketplace. Multisites cannot handle with this reseller concept and the admin only can manage with the products of reseller here. 

We have readymade multi-vendor or Marketplace plugin for WP say "Product vendors" and "WC vendors", here is our comparative analysis of Multistore plugin (Referred by you) and the above said two marketplace plugins.

In this attachment, the fields denotes "Yes" will be covered by the default feature of the plugin. Rest of the Fields with " No" need to develop those functionality additionally.

Suggestion would be to use "WC vendors" over the "Product vendors" multi-vendor plugins. As per the requirement, the website needs Multi language support and Product vendors plugin is not compatible with WPML(Wordpress Multi Language) plugin.

Additional development requires for,
